# Neuralink Software Engineering Intern, Implant Challenge


## Description

Given `mouse_recorder.py` which listens to a user's mouse events and logs the velocity every 15ms.
Given `requirements.csv` which contains the data that needs to be transcribed to the letters.

## Goal

Figure out what the user tried to handwrite with their mouse in the provided `mouse_velocities.csv`.

## Submission

Once you have deciphered the user's string, submit it in the appropriate challenge answer field on the submission page.

Be sure to attach your solution as a zip file in the appropriate field on the submission page.

To verify that you found the correct answer before submitting your application, use the `check_answer.py` script that is provided.

Note: The answer is an ascii string in ALL UPPERCASE. Make sure to submit it in all uppercase.

Good luck!

## Enhanced Decoding Pipeline and Usage

Algorithmic decoder `decode_mouse_velocities.py` that reconstructs the trajectory from velocities, segments into strokes, and classifies each stroke into uppercase letters. The decoder includes several advanced features for improved accuracy and robustness.

### Dependencies

- Python 3.9+
- numpy
- pandas

Install (optionally in a virtual environment):

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install numpy pandas
```

### Run the decoder

Use the default CSV in the project directory:

```bash
python decode_mouse_velocities.py
```

Specify a CSV path explicitly:

```bash
python decode_mouse_velocities.py --csv /Users/paullitscher/Desktop/challenge/mouse_velocities.csv
```

Verify against the provided checker:

```bash
python decode_mouse_velocities.py --csv /Users/paullitscher/Desktop/challenge/mouse_velocities.csv --check /Users/paullitscher/Desktop/challenge/check_answer.py
```

### Advanced Features

#### 1. Parameter-Free Pause Detection
- **Auto-threshold detection**: Automatically finds optimal speed threshold using histogram gap analysis
- **No magic numbers**: Eliminates manual tuning of segmentation parameters
- **Robust segmentation**: Handles varying writing speeds and pause patterns

#### 2. Enhanced Letter Recognition
- **Extended alphabet**: Support for all 26 uppercase letters (A-Z)
- **RDP simplification**: Uses Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm for cleaner shape analysis
- **Vertical extrema analysis**: Improved A/N/K disambiguation via mid-junction detection
- **Geometric rules**: Clear definitions for each letter prototype

#### 3. Writer Adaptation (Self-Training)
The decoder supports optional self-training to adapt prototypes to the current recording without using ML. It clusters the per-stroke shapes, maps clusters to letters using Chamfer distance, and blends the adapted prototypes with hand-crafted ones.

**Flags:**
- `--self_train`: enable adaptation
- `--clusters N`: number of shape clusters (default: 6)
- `--blend_weight W`: blend between hand-crafted and adapted prototypes in [0..1] (default: 0.5)
- `--verbose_self`: print cluster diagnostics
- `--auto_threshold`: auto-detect speed threshold (default: True)
- `--manual_threshold FLOAT`: manual speed threshold if auto-detection disabled

Example with adaptation and checker:

```bash
python decode_mouse_velocities.py \
  --csv /Users/paullitscher/Desktop/challenge/mouse_velocities.csv \
  --self_train --clusters 6 --blend_weight 0.5 --verbose_self \
  --check /Users/paullitscher/Desktop/challenge/check_answer.py
```

### Algorithm Improvements

The decoder implements several algorithmic enhancements:

1. **Smart Segmentation**: Uses histogram gap analysis to automatically detect optimal speed thresholds, eliminating manual parameter tuning.

2. **RDP Simplification**: Applies Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm to reduce noise and focus on essential shape features.

3. **Extrema Analysis**: Analyzes vertical extrema and mid-junctions to distinguish similar letters (A vs N vs K, O vs Q vs D).

4. **Extended Prototypes**: Comprehensive set of 26 letter prototypes with clear geometric definitions.

5. **Writer Adaptation**: Learns from the current recording to adapt prototypes to individual writing styles.

### Notes

- The CSV is expected to include columns: `timestamp`, `velocity_x`, `velocity_y`.
- The Y-axis is flipped so that up is positive during reconstruction.
- Segmentation is pause-based with automatic threshold detection enabled by default.
- All features are algorithmic - no machine learning or external models required.
